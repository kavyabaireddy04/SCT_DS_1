# Earthquake Data Analysis (2020-2024)

## Overview

This repository contains a Python script that performs exploratory data analysis and visualization on earthquake incident data from 2020 to 2024. It leverages the popular data science libraries to help users understand key characteristics and trends in earthquake magnitudes, depths, and geographic distribution.

## Objectives

* Load and clean earthquake incident data from CSV format
* Generate statistical summaries and data insights
* Visualize distributions of earthquake magnitudes and depths
* Identify and display top locations with the highest average magnitudes and earthquake counts
* Provide a reusable template for similar geospatial and temporal earthquake data analyses

## Features

* Quick preview and information summary of the dataset
* Histogram plots for magnitude and depth distributions
* Bar plots for top 10 countries/locations by average earthquake magnitude
* Bar plots for top 10 locations by earthquake incident count
* Handles missing or incomplete columns gracefully with informative messages

## Technologies

* Python 3.x
* Pandas (data manipulation)
* Matplotlib (plotting)
* Seaborn (statistical data visualization)
